# theinstaller
The ultimate lua and luarocks installer, which includes the mingw toolchain, make, AND cmake, to make this a truly working out of the box experience

The msi is in the release folder, if you want to build the installer yourself, clone this repo, and then all you gotta do is just taking the script from the .github/workflows/main.yaml, there's a bunch of bash commands, put them in a .sh file run them in the git bash shell, and then you should only need to build it from visual studio by opening the lua.sln file in the repo

Below is a video showcasing it on a vm
